# Session Timeout Fix

**Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Issue:** When session times out, user sees alert but isn't taken to login screen  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 **The Problem:**

When you opened the app after being closed and the session check timed out:
1. ❌ Alert showed "Session not found"
2. ❌ User was stuck on a screen
3. ❌ Couldn't type login credentials
4. ❌ Had to force close and reopen

---

## ✅ **The Fix:**

### **1. Removed Blocking Alert** (useAuth.tsx)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Show toast notification AFTER clearing state
setTimeout(() => {
  Alert.alert(
    'Session Not Found',
    'Unable to verify your session. Please log in again.',
    [{ text: 'OK' }]
  );
}, 100);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Don't show alert - just clear state and let user login
// The AuthGuard will handle redirecting to login screen
logger.log('✅ State cleared, redirecting to login...');
```

**Why:** The alert was blocking the navigation. Now it just clears the state silently.

---

### **2. Improved Navigation Reset** (AuthGuard.tsx)

**Before:**
```typescript
push(fallbackRoute); // Could fail if navigation state is weird
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use reset instead of push to ensure clean navigation state
reset([{ name: fallbackRoute }]);
```

**Why:** `reset()` completely resets the navigation stack, guaranteeing you land on the Login screen.

## 📊 **How It Works Now:**

### **Session Timeout Flow:**

```
1. App Opens
   ↓
2. checkUser() runs (10 second timeout)
   ↓
3. TIMEOUT! → Sets loading=false, user=null
   ↓
4. AuthGuard detects: loading=false AND user=null
   ↓
5. AuthGuard calls: reset([{ name: 'Login' }])
   ↓
6. ✅ YOU SEE LOGIN SCREEN!
   ↓
7. Type your credentials and login
```

**No alerts, no blocking, no stuck screens!** ✅

---

## ✅ **What's Fixed:**

### **Before:**
- ❌ Session timeout → Alert → Stuck
- ❌ Can't access login form
- ❌ Have to force close app
- ❌ Bad user experience

### **After:**
- ✅ Session timeout → Smooth redirect
- ✅ Login screen appears immediately
- ✅ Can type credentials right away
- ✅ Great user experience

---

## 🎯 **Session Persistence:**

### **Still Works:**
- ✅ Sessions persist across app restarts
- ✅ Stay logged in when you close/reopen app
- ✅ Only log out if you explicitly log out
- ✅ Or if session actually expires server-side

### **Only Timeout:**
- ⏱️ If session check takes > 10 seconds
- ⏱️ If network is extremely slow
- ⏱️ If Supabase is down

**But in these cases, you now get a smooth redirect to login!** ✅
